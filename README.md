# Web Groper

This Python script recursively scrapes and downloads media files (images, PDFs, etc.) from the `/wp-content/uploads` directory of a WordPress site.

## Features

- Recursively traverses URLs to find and download media files.
- Ignores resized images generated by WordPress.
- Saves downloaded files in a structured directory within the `data` folder.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `beautifulsoup4` library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:

   ```sh
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

## Usage

1. Set the `website_url` variable in the script to the base URL of the WordPress site you want to scrape (Don't include `/wp-content/uploads` in the url)
2. Run the script:

   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Configuration

- `website_url`: Base URL of the WordPress site to scrape.
- `time_between_download_requests`: Delay between download requests (in seconds).
- `output_directory`: Directory where downloaded files will be saved.
- `ignore_sizes_regex`: Regex pattern to ignore resized images generated by WordPress.

## Example

```python
# Base URL of the website to scrape
website_url = "https://example-wordpress-site.com"

# Delay between requests (in seconds)
time_between_download_requests = 1

# Directory where downloaded files will be saved
output_directory = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "data")

# Regex pattern to ignore resized images generated by WordPress
ignore_sizes_regex = r"-\d+x\d+\.[a-z]+"
```
